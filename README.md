# NoPayBA
Inspired by Laura Picard's NoPayMBA, this repository is designed to provide Open Source alternatives to the traditional 4-5 year degree by using Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Note that we currently  do not make any courses, but simply find equivalents to already existing curriculums.
