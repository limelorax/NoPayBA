# NoPayBA
Inspired by Laura Picard's [NoPayMBA](https://www.nopaymba.com), NoPayBA is designed to provide Open Source alternatives to the traditional 4-5 year degree by using Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Note that we do not make any courses or curriculums, but simply find equivalents to already existing curriculums and compile them into a list for ease of use.  

A variety of curriculums are currently being used such as  [Queens College](https://www.qc.cuny.edu) and [Berkley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) due to their ease of use when it comes to finding coursework requirements for their majors. However, more rigorous or strenient currculums may be emulated if desired.

Our primary focus is currently compiling business and humanities majors as there's a plethora of existing resources for CS majors such as [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)

The reason for doing this is simple. To get quality education to as many people as possible. Degrees often cost large sums of money that are unobtainable to most especially given that [ nearly 60% of people still live on less than $10 USD a day.](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-living-with-less-than-10-int--per-day) This makes even comparatively "affordable" institutions such as [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu) out of reach, especially considering geographic restrictions. 

Whether you're switching careers, learning for enjoyment, or simply trying to find an alternative resource to otherwise cost prohibitive education, NoPayBA has you covered by giving you the blueprint for a quality education without the hassle of burdensome loans or deadlines. We believe that the principal faculty of academia is simply the thrill and enjoyment of learning new things in and of themselves, and find it distasteful that student loan debt has now swollen to nearly [2 trillion dollars_](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/average-student-loan-debt-statistics/)

We are NOT trying to put an end to traditional education. it serves an immense purpsoe to the public and should be attended if both desired and possible. This program is built off of the work done by these universities such [MIT's OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu) and wouldn't be possible without their commitment to providing them.
